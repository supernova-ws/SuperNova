## Disclaimer
WARNING! Project status is "Alpha"! It means  that  any  update  can  seriously
change any aspect of gameplay!  Also  it  means  that  there  may  be  lack  of
documentation, no user-friendly installer. Also it means  that  any  user  that
want to use this code should have some knowledge about  configuring  web-server
with PHP  and  MySQL  and  have  knowledge  about  installing  and  configuring
PHP-scripts. However code is pretty stable and has "beta"-quality.

ENCOUNTER SUCH DIFFERENCE! Some notes about SN future development can  be  read
