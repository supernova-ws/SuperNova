WARNING! Project status is "Alpha"! It means  that  any  update  can  seriously
change any aspect of gameplay!  Also  it  means  that  there  may  be  lack  of

want to use this code should have some knowledge about  configuring  web-server
with PHP  and  MySQL  and  have  knowledge  about  installing  and  configuring
PHP-scripts. However code is pretty stable and has "beta"-quality.
