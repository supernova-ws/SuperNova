Advance notice of the need for training
=======================================
These instructions assume the ability to  customize  and  use  third-party  Web
hosting,  familiarity  with  MySQL  and  PHP,  access  to   the   tools   MySQL
administration and hosting. If you do not have the  experience  of  independent
set of sites - this distribution you will not want 

WARNING! I can not test all possible combinations and versions of MySQL & PHP &
XCache & Web Servers! This means that for  some  combinations  and  environment
settings engine can not work.  It  is  this  requires  skills  setting  up  and
configuring web servers.


Requirements
==========
MySQL 5.x - STRICT_TRANS_TABLES mode must be disabled
PHP> = 5.2.h
Web-server
XCache> = 1.2.h - optional, but very, very desirable. Without XCache not
                  will work some chips and increase significantly the load
                  to MySQL.

The engine is being developed under Windows + Apache Friends XAMPP Lite  (Basis
Package) version 1.7.3 (included  only  Apache  +  PHP  +  XCache  and  MySQL).
Production is spinning under CentOS + lighttpd + XCache.  On  localhost  engine
always operates in the mode display_errors = 1 


Location Engine
===================
The engine can run from anywhere on the site, including subdirectories.  Ie  it
may be installed at the following addresses 
  http://domain.com
  http://my.very.deep.domain.on.crappy.hoster.org
  http://hosting.com/ogame/
and so on.


Permissions of the Web server
=========================
In general, the engine can run from the web server with access rights "only  to
reading. "However, for the correct operation of individual  subsystems  account
Web server must be allowed to write in separate files/folders. Below list  of
subsystems and associated files/folders 
[*] Cache subsystem template - directory /cache. Without these templates  every
    time will be rendered anew 
[*] For the subsystem warning about attempts to hack  the  web  server  account
    should be allowed to write to the disk file/badqrys.txt.  Without  this
    "Bad" requests will not be saved 


Custom modifications
============================
If you use your own skin, template, or localization, does not change
BUILT-IN NOW! Subsequent changes in the repository can overwrite your
add! Make a copy of a skin/template/location under a different name and have
with a copy to have fun. Change the skin/template/default location can be at
configuration page server.


Installation, configuration database
=========================
WARNING! Mode STRICT_TRANS_TABLES (variable sql_mode) must be disabled!

WARNING! All tables are stored in CH InnoDB! By default, MySQL does not
Configured for normal operation with the bases InnoDB! Default settings will suffice MySQL
to work up to 50 users online. If you are planning more
simultaneous players, then you need to configure MySQL to suit your
server.
As an example, cite your MySQL server configuration (2GB memory, server
allocated solely to heart failure and supportive forum)

innodb_additional_mem_pool_size 20971520
innodb_buffer_pool_size 536870912
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit 0
innodb_flush_method O_DIRECT
innodb_log_buffer_size 8388608

Especially pay attention to the variable innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit!

It is also to facilitate disaster recovery, it is recommended to keep each
InnoDB table in a separate file. To do this, add a configuration file
Directive

innodb_file_per_table


Installing, configuring a Web server
==================================
CH is designed for use keshera op-codes xCache. Although the engine can
work without it, this mode is not regular. No keshera op-codes
Some features of the engine will be blocked, as well as increase the load
to MySQL.
Like any kesher op-codes, xCache require special configuration Web server.
How to configure a web server to work with xCache can be found on the Internet
(Www.google.com) and on the home page xCache (http://xcache.lighttpd.net/)


The installation, base
============================
 1. Create a database "supernova" UTF-8
 2. Create a MySQL user "supernova_user" and give it all right to
    base "supernova"
 3. Load the database file/docs/supernova.sql
 4. Copy the file/docs/config.php.sample the root of the supernova and
    rename it to config.php
 5. In the file/config.php on line
    "Pass" => "MYSQL_PASSWORD",// ??Password to access the MySQL server.
    MYSQL_PASSWORD to replace the password database
 6. In the file/config.php on line
    "Secretword" => "SUPERNOVA",// ??keyword to create Cookies
    SUPERNOVA replace any sequence of characters
 7. Load distribution of the supernova in the root directory of the Web server
 8. Go into the game with admin rights. The default admin account:
    Username: 'admin' (without the quotes)
    Password: 'admin' (without the quotes)
 9. MUST change the administrator password on the page/options.php
10. Set up the game on the page/admin/settings.php
11. Supernova is ready to launch!

WARNING! Scrap with team members (auth_level> 0) do not fall out! It's not a bug, it's
made specifically to enhance the security of the server! For the game, and
Administration need to use different accounts!


Installation, an advanced version
================================
Settings for database access are in the file /config.php
Game Settings are in the table <db_prefix> config. Appointment Settings
intuitive names of variables
Just some game settings are stored in file/includes/constants.php
All changes - at your own risk
WARNING! If you have changed the table prefix ('sn_' by default), then the same
need to change the names of the tables before pouring the file/docs/supernova.sql!

Multiple universes for a single server
------------------------------------
CH supports multiple universes on a single server. Different universes
must have distinct prefixes within the same space of variables
xCache


Short educational program on the GIT
====================================
Create a local copy of the supernova in the current directory (do not forget to
point end!)
  git clone git://github.com/supernova-ws/SuperNova.git .
In the current directory will be the latest copy of the supernova from the branch master.
Now you want to copy the contents to the root server. In general,
encouraged to do so once on the server - to avoid problems with
copy (this was already the case). But not all hosting companies are allowed to run
program locally, so you can first make a copy on your local drive.
In fact, have nothing else:) However, if you do modifications
engine useful to you sleduyushaya team. Roll back all changes made to
Local copy:
  git reset -=hard


Upgrading to the latest version
==============================
0. WARNING! UPDATING TO MAKE A BACKUP DATABASE AND FILE ENGINE  THAT  would  be
   possible to roll back if the update fails! 
1. Log in to the game through an account with administrator privileges
2. WARNING! Before you upgrade a server MUST be stopped. Done this  way:  under
   the Administrator in the left menu appears select "Administrator" - click on
   it. In the admin menu, select "Settings," put check  "Turn  off  the  game",
   press "Save" button at the bottom of the page. Only  then  can  perform  the
   update - otherwise the result may be far from expected.
3. If you have template caching enabled, you must delete all the files in
   directory/cache
4. Now update the files to the engine
   4.1. If you put the game out of GIT-repository, the server at the root
        directory, run game
          git pull
   4.2. In any other case - to upload an updated version of the engine
5. Wait for the NEW version of the engine is on the server! An attempt to update
   in the process of copying files or downloading them from the repository can GIT
   lead to unpredictable results
6. Switch to the browser in which you are logged in as administrator and
   select "Browse." Wait for the page - this time
   updates the database
7. And finally, after all this is a game you can again turn
   (Admin -> Options, uncheck "Turn off the game" and keep
   changes).

Upgrade from RR
------------
Automatic upgrade from bases in the development of RR. Partially upgrade done
automatically launch the file update.php

In heart failure with respect to RR changed location banner. Earlier reference was
 /Scripts/createbanner.php
New Links
 /Banner.php

Use the tools the web server (mod_rewrite) to redirect requests. In
Specifically, the rule for lighttpd is as follows:

# Redirects old-style banners to new one
server.modules + = ("mod_rewrite")
url.rewrite-once = (
  "^/Scripts/createbanner.php (.*)" =>"/banner.php $ 1 "
)

If you have problems with updating ...
---------------------------------------
It is impossible to predict all possible combinations of settings, PHP, MySQL and
Web server. CH focuses on the "default settings". Therefore, in some
cases, possible failures in the upgrade procedure. An algorithm for automatic
Pack is designed for a single run. However, in some
configurations during the upgrade, errors occur. Some of them -
critical, and some can fix restarting procedure (with or without
editing database). Run the update again be using
select "Force update" menu "Utilities" page of the Administrator. Please
pay attention! Using the forced update may lead to
damage to the database (if the update itself over the previously successful)!
Forced update should be used only if
standard update procedure was not successful! If it did not help -
should go to Diagnostiek fault

Fault diagnosis engine
=================================
The latest and most current version of the engine (with the most recent and relevant bugs)
can be downloaded at this link:
https://github.com/supernova-ws/SuperNova/archives/trunk
Click on �Download. Zip� and download archives trunk. At what exactly should go on
link above and click the button there. Go direct link to the download
- Does not work.
To pay attention to the file name is not necessary.
! WARNING! Diagnosis should be performed on a separate database and separate copy
engine! DO NOT LIVE IN diagnosis SERVER!

The standard sequence of steps in the diagnosis of this:
1. Set in an empty database clean dump a database from an archive. Problems in this
   stage, say the following:
   1. The most likely - an error in setting up the MySQL server
   2. Errors in the dump database. Perhaps you are in a time of renewal dump.
      "Moment" here relative concept - it can take several days
2. Put on a clean server and a clean database, obtained at the last step, the engine
   from the archive. Try to run. Problems at this stage, say the following:
   1. Errors in the configuration engine. Check the file/config.php
   2. Errors in the HTTP-server settings (especially if the first run
   engine)
   3 Errors in avtoapdeytere
   4. The engine is in the process of writing, but you got to "moment" commit
3. Replace the clean database dump of your working database (do not forget if you want to AGAIN
   change the configuration - prefix tables there, logins/passwords, etc.).
   Problems at this stage, say the following:
   1. Errors in the configuration engine. Check the file/config.php
   2. Errors in avtoapdeytere
   3. Errors in the database itself. Then a deal themselves, or pay for my work
4. If there are no problems - then something is not specifically as a live server. Here we have
   have to understand more - either by themselves or pay for my work

Before each stage ALWAYS need to restart the web server and MySQL - otherwise
can be used by the old settings from the previous version.
Only a true and accurate diagnostic procedure to follow will help to effectively
identify problems in the SN on each individual server.
